3339,Rapper T.I.: Trump a ’Poster Child For White Supremacy’,"Rapper T. I. unloaded on black celebrities who met with Donald Trump after the election, saying they failed to challenge the president for disrespecting and degrading black voters during the campaign. [The Atlanta — based artist told the of The View Thursday that he took issue with talk show host Steve Harvey, Kanye West, and football Hall of Famer and civil rights champion Jim Brown meeting with Trump. “Before you stand and smile and say this is a good man and take pictures, what about addressing the disrespect and disregard for our community that was done?” T. I. said, adding “And what about him being the poster child for white supremacy and standing for the people who look to devalue our lives?” The star of the VH1 reality show T. I. Tiny: The Family Hustle also defended fellow rapper Snoop Dogg, who recently starred in a music video that sees the “Doggystyle” rapper pull a gun on and “shoot” a parody clown version of President Donald Trump. “Whatever Snoop said, he had the right to say. He’s protected by the Constitution in saying it,” T. I. said. “We have to protect our legends. We have to protect our heroes and the people who mean something to us and our community and our culture. ” The View Sunny Hostin suggested that Trump advisor Omarosa Manigault has stated the administration’s intention to “bridge the gap” between the White House and the black community, to which T. I. responded with a personal insult. “She can’t even bridge the gap in her teeth,” the rapper said. T. I. had originally defended Snoop Dogg and his controversial video in an Instagram message, calling Trump a “f*cking tangerine tanned muskrat scrotum skin, lacefront possum fur wig wearing, alternative fact, atomic dog diarrhea face ass man [sic]. ” Follow Jerome Hudson on Twitter: @JeromeEHudson",news
782,Legal marijuana could overtake manufacturing in job creation by 2020,"More Try Yahoo Finance on Firefox » (Uriel Sinai/Getty) Marijuana could be the next mega-industry in the US. A new report from New Frontier Data, a business intelligence firm focused on cannabis, projects the legal weed market will create more than a quarter of a million jobs by 2020. In comparison, manufacturing jobs are expected to decline by 814,000 by 2024, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. 2016 was a watershed year for the budding industry. Eight states voted to legalize pot in some form, bringing the number of states with comprehensive medical marijuana laws to 28. One in five Americans can legally get high without a letter from a doctor. As more people leave the black market for the safety, convenience, and product diversity that legal dispensaries offer, the industry's job growth could explode. Legal marijuana businesses employed an estimated 100,000 to 150,000 workers in January, according to the Marijuana Business Daily. That estimate includes growers, scientists, dispensary employees, and tech entrepreneurs developing ancillary services like the ""Yelp of weed"" or ""Uber for pot."" New Frontier based its projections on an analysis from the Marijuana Policy Group, an economic and policy cannabis consulting firm that works with the state of Colorado. The report assumes every state will have a medical and adult-use market in place by 2020 — a rather optimistic outlook. It's also banking on the belief that President Donald Trump will stand by his vow to support states' rights to legislate their own marijuana policy, despite warnings of a crackdown from Press Secretary Sean Spicer and Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Giadha Aguirre De Carcer, founder and CEO of New Frontier Data, described the forecast as ""an optimal view of the market that demonstrates what potential job creation could be if legal cannabis is operating freely and openly,"" in a statement. (Dispensary employees, called ""budtenders,"" man the counter at medical marijuana shop Caliva in San Jose, California.Caliva) There's some evidence to suggest New Frontier's projections are on the right track. In Colorado, which legalized pot outright in 2012 and opened the recreational market in 2014, the industry has created roughly 18,000 jobs, according to the Marijuana Policy Group. California, home to the world's sixth largest economy, fully legalized marijuana last November. Its state capital region alone could see 20,000 jobs created if it becomes a hub for the industry. The legal marijuana market is expected to top $24.5 billion in 2025, based solely on the states that passed medical or recreational legalization initiatives before 2017.

1323,A Mom Shared The Annoying Things Said About Her Daughter With Down Syndrome And Other Moms Joined In,"“She is a 4-month-old baby who happens to have Down syndrome,” Caroline Boudet wrote. “It’s not what she IS, it’s what she HAS.” Here is my baby girl, Louise. She is 4 months old, has two legs, two arms, and one extra chromosome. Please, when you meet a Louise, do not ask her mother, ‘how come you did not find out during the pregnancy?’ Either they did, and the parents took the decision to keep the baby. Or they didn’t, and it was surprising enough for them to talk about it over and over now. Keep in your mind that mothers have a tendency to feel guilty about each and every thing, so a surprising extra chromosome… I’ll let you make up your mind. Don’t tell her mother, ‘it’s your baby no matter what.’ No. It’s my baby, period. Plus, ‘nomatterwhat’ is quite an ugly name, I’d rather call her Louise. Don’t tell her mother: ‘As she a Down baby, she will… etc.’ No. She is a 4-month-old baby who happens to have Down syndrome. It’s not what she IS, it’s what she HAS. You wouldn’t say, ‘she’s a cancer baby.’ Don’t say, ‘they’re like this, they’re like that.’ ‘They’ all have their features, their character, their own tastes, their life. ‘They’ are as different between them as you are from you neighbor. I know that if one does not experience it, one does not think about it but words do matter. They can comfort and they can hurt. So just give it a thought, especially if you’re a doctor or nurse of any kind. I usually do not make my status public on Facebook, but this one will be. You can read it and share it as you want. Because each year there are (in France) 500 new ‘mothers of Louise’ that can have a day ruined by those kind of words. I know it’s not meant to hurt. But you just need to know. Monday I went with Louise to a meeting where I was made to listen of all these remarks. I came back crying, I needed a release. I know this is not malice, it’s ignorance. I too could have said these things before… This is exactly why I thought it was necessary to talk. So I posted this status on Facebook, saying that if people share, it would be always better than nothing. Adorable, this little cutie. A very beautiful declaration of love of a mom to a small adorable Louise… Beautiful life to you. I kiss you. Marie. So true! Bravo! I have 30-year-old son with Down syndrome. I understand you so much. I’ve spread this kind of message for 30 years and unfortunately, I think they will do it for centuries and centuries, but it is important not to stop writing these messages. One day, maybe, people will understand better what we live. My son Jean Robert Boucher is wonderful, sociable, tender, full of life and full of talent. We wouldn’t swap him for anything in the world.

303,Chile sentences 33 over Pinochet-era disappearances,"Share this with Email Facebook Messenger Messenger Twitter Pinterest WhatsApp LinkedIn Copy this link These are external links and will open in a new window The High Court in Chile has sentenced 33 former intelligence agents for the disappearance of five political activists in 1987. The court said that the five had been abducted and killed, and their bodies thrown into the sea. Investigators said they were killed in revenge for the abduction of an army colonel by left-wing guerrillas. The five are believed to have been the last people kidnapped under the rule of Gen Augusto Pinochet from 1973 to 1990. Those sentenced are former members of the CNI intelligence service, the army's intelligence battalion and the army's flight commando. Among them are former CNI head Gen Hugo Salas Wenzel and the CNI's ex-chief of operations, Maj Alvaro Corbalan Castilla. The two, who are already serving sentences for human rights abuses, were given 15 years in prison each. The remaining defendants were sentenced to jail terms ranging between five and 10 years, with one released subject to conditions. The five disappeared activists were members of the Communist Party and its militant wing, the Manuel Rodriguez Patriot Front, which used guerrilla tactics to fight the rule of Gen Pinochet. They were arrested in September 1987 by the secret police in retaliation for the abduction of Col Carlos Carreño by the Manuel Rodriguez Patriot Front. Col Carreño was kidnapped on 1 September 1987 and released three months later after his family agreed to the kidnappers' demand for $50,000 (£40,000) in food and clothing for Chile's poor. The bodies of the five were never found but Judge Mario Carroza's investigations revealed that they had been thrown into the sea from a helicopter off the coast of Valparaiso. It is not clear whether they were still alive but drugged at the time or if they had already been killed in detention. More than 3,200 people were killed or disappeared during Gen Pinochet's rule, according to official figures. Gen Pinochet came to power in a military coup in 1973, when he overthrew the socialist government of President Salvador Allende. Outside Chile, he is remembered as a ruthless dictator whose military regime tortured and killed thousands of opponents and drove many into exile. But inside Chile he still has a small but ardent group of right-wing supporters who regard him as a hero for ""saving the country from becoming another Cuba"". He stepped down from power in 1990, two years after he lost a referendum on whether he should remain in power.

664,Eric Holder to help investigate Uber sexual harassment allegations,"Feb. 21 (UPI) — Uber hired former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder to help lead an investigation into sexual harassment and discrimination recently alleged by a former employee. In a memo to employees, Uber CEO Travis Kalanick said the review will be conducted in “short order” and that it will involve Holder, Huffington Post founder and Uber board member Ariana Huffington, and Liane Hornsey, Uber’s new human resources chief. A blog post by former Uber engineer Susan Fowler prompted the investigation. She said she was sexually harassed by a supervisor almost immediately after she started at the company, and said her complaints were ignored by human resources. Over the course of a year Fowler said she was threatened and sabotaged by management because she complained about the harassment. On Sunday, Kalanick tweeted, hours after Fowler’s blog post spread online, that he was launching an “urgent investigation” into allegations she made that she was denied transfers and job opportunities because of sexism among managers. Kalanick told employees in the memo the review conducted by Holder, Huffington and Hornsey will investigate both Fowler’s claims and “diversity and inclusion at Uber more broadly.” “What is driving me through all this is a determination that we take what’s happened as an opportunity to heal wounds of the past and set a new standard for justice in the workplace,” Kalanick wrote. Holder was former President Barack Obama’s U.S. Attorney General from 2009 until 2015, when he was succeeded by Loretta Lynch. Other women at the company have experienced the same harassment, Fowler wrote in her post, which she says is why the number of women working at the company dwindled during her 12 months there. Within a few weeks of training, Fowler alleged her boss propositioned her in a messaging application, telling her he was in an open marriage and looking for a new partner. When Fowler told human resources, bringing them screenshots of the conversation, she said she was told nothing could be done about it, and that it was possible she’d have to deal with some type of backlash for having reported him. Fowler later attempted to transfer to a different department — based on her performance reviews, she should have been eligible — but her managers changed her reviews so she could not transfer, because they were trying to keep women on their teams, she said.

1177,Security Heightened at Times Square for New Year's Eve Celebrations,"Massive 20-ton sanitation trucks, weighted with an extra 15 tons of sand, will surround the iconic New Year's Eve celebration in Times Square, officials said Thursday (Dec. 29), describing a security measure meant to stop deadly truck-driving attacks into crowds like those in Germany and France. The placement of the 65 trucks, along with 100 patrol cars, at intersections surrounding Times Square is a new element to an already heavily policed event that will include 7,000 officers, specially armed counterterrorism units and bomb-sniffing dogs. ""We live in a changing world now,"" New York Police Department Commissioner James O'Neil said. ""It can't just be, 'What happens in New York, what happens in the United States?' It has to be more, 'What happens worldwide?'"" A Tunisian man who plowed a truck into a Christmas market in Berlin this month killed 12 people and injured 56 others. His attack followed a more deadly assault in Nice, France, in July that left 86 people dead when a man drove a 20-ton refrigerated truck into a crowd celebrating Bastille Day. New York police studied those events in planning their Times Square security. ""As we formulated this year's plan, we paid close attention to world events and we learned from those events,"" said Carlos Gomez, the NYPD's chief of department. More than 1 million people are expected to attend the annual ball drop countdown in Manhattan, and officials said they didn't know of any terror threats. The security measures are part of augmented precautions across the nation for New Year's Eve. To keep Las Vegas' lavish celebration secure, the entire police force will be working or on-call with help from the FBI, the National Guard and the Secret Service and will close roads and beef up barriers to prevent vehicle attacks. Times Square revelers, who are prohibited from carrying umbrellas and large bags, will be screened at two points: once when they approach the Crossroads of the World and again when they enter one of the 65 pens that hold thousands of people each. And, as in past years, officials have removed trash bins and mailboxes, sealed manhole covers and done sweeps of parking garages and hotels. Police in New York have used trucks as blocker vehicles before, though never on this scale. The sand-filled trucks were deployed in November at the Thanksgiving Day parade and on Election Day, when they were posted outside Donald Trump's Trump Tower, at two Manhattan hotels and at a convention center used by Hillary Clinton's campaign. Investigators also are reviewing the records of truck rental companies, said James Waters, chief of the NYPD's counterterrorism bureau. The large trucks aren't the only offering from the Department of Sanitation, said Kathryn Garcia, the sanitation commissioner. About 280 employees will be on hand to clean up between 40 and 50 tons of debris after the ball drops following the 60-second countdown to 2017, she said.",news
1244,Geller: Why Trump Is Failing,"Make no mistake: the failure to repeal and replace Obamacare, which President Trump had so often promised to do, was a major defeat for his administration. The beginning of his administration is when President Trump had the chance to accomplish the most. But it’s not looking that way. He has certainly tried but is being thwarted at every turn by leftist activist judges and the RINO establishment. According to The Hill, “Trump became heavily involved in selling and negotiating the plan, holding at least 17 meetings on overhauling the healthcare system….Those included arm-twisting sessions (in person and on Twitter) with conservative and moderate factions that opposed the plan, as well as invites to the White House bowling alley and a rare personal trip to Capitol Hill. His aides were more than eager to tout ‘The Art of the Deal’ author’s abilities to get people to come to an agreement. ‘He is the closer,’ White House press secretary Sean Spicer said Wednesday.” So what happened? Trump has to take control. Take a page from Obama and clean house. With regard to Obamacare, Trump should take decisive action to salvage the situation now. He should call every GOP congressman into his office and just hammer out a deal. Here’s the thing: he talks about being a great negotiator, and that may be true. But throughout his career until now, he has been negotiating not with politicians, but with businessmen. We know their motive: profit. Money. It’s not the same with politicians. Politics is a twisted world, in which power and reelection are the currency in which they trade. The bottom line in business is money, and while money talks for politicians also, the bottom line with these corrupt clowns is not always so easy to discern. Breitbart News reminded us recently that House Speaker Paul Ryan “was caught on an audio file from October—obtained by Breitbart News and published a couple weeks ago—saying he is ‘not going to defend Donald Trump—not now, not in the future.’” And Trump was relying on him to repeal and replace Obamacare? Paul Ryan is also out of his depth. Love him or hate him, former House majority leader Tom DeLay knew how to herd those cats. That’s why the left had to destroy him. Ryan lacks what DeLay had: “bold aggressiveness and quiet maneuvering.” Ryan has got to go. James Comey, too. What’s with all the Obama holdovers throughout the Trump administration? The Justice Department’s civil rights division must be purged. What’s Eric Treene still doing there? In January 2012, after receiving a huge box (in response to my Freedom of Information Act request) full of documents relating to the Justice Department’s interactions with Muslim groups linked to Hamas and the Muslim Brotherhood, I wrote: Even more striking was the servile demeanor of the Civil Rights Division official Eric Treene, Special Counsel for the Department of Justice, Civil Rights Division, and the demanding condescension of Muslim Brotherhood operatives. Muslim and Arab operatives treat Treene and Co. like an errand boy, asking them for email addresses of other contacts and setting them to perform the most menial gofer duties.  The DOJ even takes lunch orders and picks up the tab, and in some cases asks them how much money they need for a little soiree they’re holding. It is astonishing. Yet Treene is still there, and doubtless still kowtowing. And he is not the only one. A senior Trump administration official said last week: “We have members of the former administration at the highest levels who through their actions after January 20 have demonstrated their refusal to recognize the results of the general election. They have pursued, organized, and managed a comprehensive subversion of the new administration.” The Washington Free Beacon reports that “in one instance, Trump administration officials found evidence that the administration’s executive order banning travel from certain Muslim-majority nations had been selectively altered to bring it more in line with Obama-era talking points. Several hours before the orders were set to be signed by Trump, officials noticed that language concerning ‘radical Islamic terrorism’ had been stripped from the order and replaced with Obama-era language about countering violent extremism. West Wing staffers quickly scrambled to rewrite the order to bring it back in line with Trump’s rhetoric.” That’s unconscionable. Whoever did that should have been immediately identified and fired. It’s not too late for Trump. But it will be soon if he doesn’t remember what got him elected in the first place, and drain the swamp.

2166,The latest Jane Austen riff is ‘Pride and Prejudice’ and yawning,"It is a truth universally acknowledged that “Pride and Prejudice and Zombies” is a pretty silly idea. So why on Earth is this movie, based on the satirical book by Seth not having more fun? From the “Colonel” Darcy (Sam Riley) to generic undead carnage, the other, better mashup component is often overshadowed: Jane Austen’s comedy of manners about a man, a woman and England’s patriarchal property laws. Here, Elizabeth Bennet (Lily James) isn’t just a skeptic of romance and matrimony; she’s also a deadly Shaolin martial artist, thanks to her survivalist father (Charles Dance): “My daughters were trained for battle, sir, not the kitchen. ” An animated sequence explains how a “virulent and abominable” zombie plague came, rather karmically, from one of the colonies, obliterating London but kept at bay from the countryside. Here, the landed gentry continue on with their lifestyles, weapons close at hand. Director Burr Steers (“17 Again”) nails the aesthetics — zombies in ornate period dress are both amusing and chilling — but has his actors playing it completely, thuddingly straight. I don’t think Riley cracks a smile once. But the curmudgeonly Darcy also needs an endearing awkwardness and wit — and Riley, sorry to say, is no Darcy. James (“Cinderella”) seems game for high camp, but is denied: Stripped of most of Austen’s withering prose, she’s a passable action figure in passably filmed action sequences. Occasionally, Steers gets it right: When Darcy first proposes to Elizabeth, mostly via insults, the exchange earns him a roundhouse kick to his chest — as it maybe always should have. Matt Smith (“Doctor Who”) hamming it up as the pretentious parson Mr. Collins, is a brief comic gem. Heir to the Bennet fortune, he’s looking for a bride among the sisters — who cringe at his attempts at flirting and obsequious boasts about his patron, Lady Catherine de Bourgh (Lena Headey) England’s most decorated zombie slayer. The sweet romance between Jane Bennet (Bella Heathcote) and Bingley (Douglas Booth) is a footnote, while Mr. Wickham (Jack Huston) goes from being a sniveling con artist to, improbably, a supervillain. But the film’s biggest misstep is its unwillingness to embrace its own title: There is “Pride and Prejudice” or there are zombies; they’re too rarely intertwined. The result is, as our heroine might say, tolerable at best.",news
2045,This is going to be harder than Donald Trump expected,"(CNN)On the campaign trail, President Donald Trump promised to take a blowtorch and pliers to the Washington political establishment. But three weeks into his presidency, he has been repeatedly disarmed and frustrated by partisan opponents and the machinery of a government designed to check his power. It hasn't been for a lack of trying. Trump over his first 21 days in office has issued a barrage of executive actions aimed at delivering on a range of policy pledges -- including many of his most aggressive and controversial. But the January 27 travel ban has become a millstone on the neck of a young administration that has spent the last two weeks digging deeper into a legal battle that now seems destined for the Supreme Court. Much of the emerging image of dysfunction has been painted by Trump's own staff. The calls are coming from inside the White House -- and they are going to reporters, who have been flooded with accounts of a frenetic and angry president, who bounces from political frustration to personal grudge -- often in his bathrobe, according to a New York Times account disputed by the White House -- in the space of a few minutes. Now, with the foot soldiers of his Republican majority under siege in their home districts, the blustering outsider who chalked up his predecessors' failures to their lack of will or guile, is seeing his own challenged daily. A growing barrier to 'The Wall' ""I would build a great wall, and nobody builds walls better than me, believe me, and I'll build them very inexpensively,"" Trump said during his June 2015 campaign kick-off. ""I will build a great great wall on our southern border and I'll have Mexico pay for that wall."" Trump's promise to build a wall on the southern border was a consistent crowd-pleaser during the campaign. Congressional Republicans have vowed to finance its construction, but have been short on the how and when details. His guarantee that the Mexican government would foot the bill, which could, according a Reuters report out Thursday, cost more than $20 billion, had been one of the pitch's key selling point. But their president, under pressure at home, has balked and dismissed it out of hand. When the White House floated a 20% tariff on Mexican imports to cover the upfront costs, there was a rare bipartisan meltdown and the trial balloon was quickly deflated. Repeal and replace Obamacare with ... what? ""Something terrific,"" Trump said during a July 2015 interview with CNN's Dana Bash, who asked what he would push in place of Obamacare. Pressed to provide a bit more detail, Trump advocated for allowing people to buy insurance across state lines. But that carries concerns for critics from both sides of the aisle. It's been more than 18 months since that conversation -- and nearly seven years since President Barack Obama signed and Affordable Care Act into law -- but Trump and Republicans do not yet have a viable replacement to shop. In a Sunday interview with Fox News, the President called the process ""very complicated"" and suggested it could last into 2018 -- a midterm election year. And with demonstrators flooding town hall meetings to rail against Republicans' health care plan, or a convincing lack thereof, full repeal seems a long ways off. Some doubts on the homefront A little more than a week before his inauguration, Trump declared at a wild press conference in New York that ""Russia, China, Japan, Mexico, all countries will respect us far more, far more than they do under past administrations."" Trump during his campaign, and after being elected, asserted over and again the US, mostly because of Obama, had been diminished in the eyes of the world. He pledged to reverse that and restore those purported losses. While it's unclear exactly how outsiders' views of the US have shifted over the past three weeks, Gallup found that only 29% Americans believe ""other countries around the world have respect for the president."" Two-thirds of respondents said they did not. Here's how those numbers stack up against Presidents Obama and George W. Bush at similar stages of their first terms: Travel ban and a reckoning with the courts Another central tenet of his campaign, the ban -- proposed at first to target all Muslims, then reframed after his swearing-in to focus on citizens from seven majority Muslim nations -- has been the administration's most controversial initiative so far. The executive order, which also paused the US refugee program and halted the entry of Syrian refugees indefinitely, set off mass protests around the country. Within 24 hours, judges were hearing arguments against it. Now, after seeing it blocked in multiple venues, Trump will have to decide if he wants a Supreme Court showdown or to go back to the drawing board. On Friday, he signaled both options remained on the table. And more pointedly, doubled down on his argument in favor of some kind of ban. ""There are tremendous threats to our country,"" he said during a joint press conference with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, eschewing specifics but suggesting that he, as President, was privy to information that would shake the broader public. However it plays out, what's clear now is that Trump's December 2015 announcement ""calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country's representatives can figure out what is going on"" is a long way off -- and even more measured versions have significant challenges ahead. Sanctuary cities no harbor for Trump's policies In another early executive action, Trump signed an order seeking to ""ensure that jurisdictions that fail to comply with applicable Federal law do not receive Federal funds, except as mandated by law."" Delivered days before the travel ban, this too set off an avalanche of protest, both in the streets and among mostly Democratic leaders in major urban centers like New York, Chicago and Los Angeles. Smaller cities like New Haven, Connecticut, and Austin, Texas, have also threatened to fight back in court. And in an ironic twist, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti (among others) pointed to a 2012 Supreme Court case to explain why they're so confident. The ruling in NFIB vs. Sebelius, which allowed states to reject Medicaid expansion without the threat of losing pre-existing funds, set a precedent Trump's opponents say will prevent him from using federal money as a tool to coerce local governments. In the private dealings of his family business, Trump's decision-making went unquestioned -- at least publicly. But the presidency is ruled by a different calculus, one its new resident, three weeks into his four year term, is struggling to command.",clickbait
2010,Syria's brutal war is moving towards another round of peace talks,"Reuters Feb. 12, 2017, 3:26 PM 4 facebook linkedin twitter email print AMMAN (Reuters) - Syria's main opposition body on Sunday approved a new delegation to take part in Geneva peace talks later this month, which include Russian-backed blocs that have been critical of the armed insurgency against President Bashar al-Assad. The High Negotiation Committee, (HNC) the main umbrella group, said in a statement after two-days of meetings in the Saudi capital, Riyadh, that the new 21-member negotiating team included members of two dissident alliances with which it has previously been at odds. Those two alliances -- the so-called Moscow and Cairo groups -- have long disavowed the armed rebellion and insisted that political change can only come through peaceful activism. Their members include a former Syrian government minister with close ties to Moscow. Mohammad Sabra, who was appointed as chief negotiator, told Saudi-owned Al-Hadath news channel that the delegation brought together various groups. He also accused unnamed foreign powers of trying to impose their views on the composition of the delegation, an apparent reference to Russia. The body also chose a new head of the negotiating team, Nasr al Hariri, a veteran opposition figure from southern Syria. The next round of U.N.-sponsored talks on the conflict, now in its sixth year, have been scheduled for Feb. 20. The HNC said in the statement the goal of the negotiations was a political transition under U.N. auspices in which Assad had no role in the future of the country. But it steered away from its previous insistence the Syrian president should leave at the start of a transitional phase. The HNC also said foreign powers had no right to present a vision of Syria's future political system without the consent of Syrians. Russian last month tabled the draft of a proposed new constitution for Syria, though it insisted the document had been circulated for the purposes of discussion only. The HNC represented the opposition in Geneva talks last year. But it was not invited to recently convened talks in the Kazakh capital, Astana. The indirect talks between government and rebel delegates in Astana were held with the aim of shoring up a ceasefire brokered by Turkey and Russia.

84,Washington Pizzeria Gunman Pleads Guilty to Weapons Charges ,"WASHINGTON — A 28-year-old North Carolina man pleaded guilty Friday in federal court to firing a military-style assault rifle inside a Washington pizza restaurant as he investigated spurious claims in online articles that the pizzeria was at the center of a child sex-slave ring. The man, Edgar Maddison Welch, of Salisbury, N.C., also admitted that he transported a firearm and ammunition across state lines, a federal charge. He faces up to two decades in prison on both felony charges, but prosecutors and defense lawyers agreed he should serve no more than a maximum of seven years. Mr. Welch, who remains in custody, is scheduled to be sentenced in June. According to prosecutors, Mr. Welch traveled on Dec. 4 from North Carolina to the Comet Ping Pong restaurant in Northwest Washington after reading unfounded online reports that the restaurant had been harboring child sex slaves as part of a child-abuse ring led by Hillary Clinton, then the Democratic nominee for president. Prosecutors said Mr. Welch also watched YouTube videos about the false stories. The authorities said Mr. Welch told friends that he was “sacrificing the lives of a few for the lives of many” and “standing up against a corrupt system that kidnaps, tortures and rapes babies and children in our own backyard.” Prosecutors said his friends declined to help carry out his mission. While driving, Mr. Welch sent messages and made a video suggesting he might not return home alive. Mr. Welch was armed with an AR-15 rifle, a .38-caliber revolver and a shotgun when he arrived at the restaurant. At about 3 p.m., he walked into the pizzeria with the rifle and holstered handgun, which was visible to employees and patrons. He left the shotgun in the car. Prosecutors said people inside the restaurant panicked and fled. While inside, Mr. Welch fired his rifle into a locked door and also pointed the weapon at an employee carrying pizza dough. Mr. Welch spent about 20 minutes inside the restaurant and then walked unarmed outside, where he was arrested. Prosecutors said Mr. Welch left the rifle and handgun in the restaurant. In an interview with The New York Times shortly after his arrest, Mr. Welch said he had gone to the restaurant with good intentions. He said the “thought of innocent people suffering” broke his heart. But he also said he regretted how he handled the situation.",news
2619,"Kareem Abdul-Jabbar: In this crucial election, I’m endorsing Hillary Clinton","Kareem is an author, commentator and former professional basketball player. There is a tradition in U. S. politics of somberly proclaiming that each election is The Most Important in History. The idea, of course, is to scare people into voting for some candidate or another. This is done by describing an apocalyptic future like some sadistic camp counselor telling horror stories at bedtime with a flashlight under his chin. In making this assertion so frequently, we run the risk of sounding like the boy who cried wolf, and therefore not being taken seriously when an election comes around that really is important to American history. As this one is. This isn’t because we have a female candidate who may be her party’s nominee. That would be historically significant, as was electing Barack Obama as the first black president. His race and her gender inform who they are, as any person’s cultural background does, but it’s policies that maketh the politician. And it’s policies that make me endorse Hillary Clinton for president of the United States. From Snoop Dogg and Tim Allen to Tila Tequila and Ronda Rousey, here’s a look at some of the unexpected celebrity endorsements this election season. (Gillian Washington Post) Before I get into the reasons I support Clinton, let me first explain why this election really is so important. On Aug. 8, 1945 — two days after the bombing of Hiroshima — Albert Camus wrote an essay warning future generations about the choices before them: “This is no longer a prayer but a demand to be made by all peoples to their governments — a demand to choose definitively between hell and reason. ” That is what the stakes of this election are: We are choosing between hell and reason. America was founded on the principles emanating from the Age of Reason, also known as the Age of Enlightenment. But today, with the rise of Republican candidates such as Donald Trump and Ted Cruz, we are witnessing a rejection of these foundational ideals in favor of a hellish chaos of lies, misdirection, attacks on the Constitution and, most harmful to the country, a rejection of reason. This last item is especially evident in Trump’s continued dominance despite the fact that so many people in his own party have vigorously rejected his inflammatory rhetoric, empty promises and lack of knowledge. I’m frustrated and angry at hearing about frustration and anger toward Washington gridlock as an excuse for embracing candidates who will only add to the problem. But that’s what is happening with Trump and Cruz supporters. These voters share a distrust of experts, preferring “the wisdom of ordinary people. ” Really? I prefer the wisdom of a trained physician when I have pain in my chest. One of the problems in Washington is that some legislators ignore the experts, such as the international community of scientists who have studied and confirmed global warming, so as to bury their heads and do nothing. When did we start devaluing intelligence and knowledge? That’s why electing Clinton is important not just to maintaining the integrity of the United States but also to preventing an international trend that threatens to unleash a triumph of hatred and fear over reason. We are in a defining battle between the resurgence of the irrational, and all the horrors that have historically gone with it — violence, bigotry, fascism — and reason, with all the advances that have accompanied it — justice and freedom for all, regardless of ethnic background, social status, gender or sexual orientation. I like Bernie Sanders, both for his populism and the dedication to the welfare of all Americans in his heart. He’s a decent man with the courage of his convictions. He will make a strong ally for Clinton. But Clinton possesses that rare but crucial combination of idealism and pragmatism. She can both envision a better world and take the necessary steps to make that vision a reality. She embodies the principles of the Age of Reason and isn’t afraid to fight against the confederacy of dunces who would undermine the principles of inclusion and diversity that America stands for. Clinton has a long and distinguished history of fighting hard for and Americans. As first lady, she could have taken a traditional ornamental and passive role, but she chose a path as an activist. She has been an advocate of national health care since 1993, despite fierce opposition from the industry. We wouldn’t have the Affordable Care Act — which has brought coverage to millions — if not for her early efforts. I especially appreciate Clinton’s unflinching support of President Obama’s policies, which have lifted many Americans both economically and socially, despite the battered economy that he inherited. Continuing the direction of those policies, including reforming a bail system that targets the poor, drug laws that target minorities and an education system that saddles college students with unbearable debts, must be a priority if the United States is to be the land of equal opportunity it brands itself to be. This election truly is a choice between hell and reason, and I want the best, candidate to ensure that the United States lands on the right side of that battle. In Clinton we have a proven warrior who has both the commitment and record of accomplishment to lead the fight. Read more about this topic: Sander M.

941,Here’s the Reality About Illegal Immigrants in the United States ,"There are 11 million of them, the best estimates say, laboring in American fields, atop half-built towers and in restaurant kitchens, and swelling American classrooms, detention centers and immigration courts. In the public’s mind, the undocumented — the people living here without permission from the American government — are Hispanic, mostly Mexican and crossed the southwestern border in secret. In the eyes of their advocates, they are families and workers, taking the jobs nobody else wants, staying out of trouble, here only to earn their way to better, safer lives for themselves and their children. At the White House, they are pariahs, criminals who menace American neighborhoods, take American jobs, sap American resources and exploit American generosity: They are people who should be, and will be, expelled. Illegal immigrants can be many of these things, and more. Eleven million allows for considerable range, crosshatched with contradictions. There may be no more powerful symbol of how fixedly Americans associate illegal immigration with Mexico than the wall President Trump has proposed building along the southern border. But many of the unauthorized are not Mexican; almost a quarter are not even Hispanic. Guatemala 723,000 El Salvador 465,000 Hon- duras 337,000 China 268,000 India 267,000 Korea 198,000 Mexico 6.2 million Ecuador Philippines Colombia Other countries 2.1 million Mexico 6.2m Guatemala 723,000 El Salvador 465,000 Honduras 337,000 China India Korea Ecuador Colombia Philippines Other countries 2.1 million Guatemala 723,000 El Salvador 465,000 Honduras 337,000 China 268,000 India 267,000 Korea 198,000 Mexico 6.2 million   Ecuador Philippines Colombia Other countries 2.1 million Guatemala 723,000 El Salvador 465,000 Honduras 337,000 Korea 198,000 China 268,000 India 267,000 Mexico 6.2 million Ecuador Philippines Colombia Other countries 2.1 million Mexico 6.2 million Guatemala 723,000 El Salvador 465,000 Honduras 337,000 India China Korea Ecuador Colombia Philippines Other countries 2.1 million After Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras, the largest number of unauthorized immigrants comes from China (an estimated 268,000), where deportations run aground on a less literal wall: China is one of 23 countries that do not cooperate with deportations. (The Trump administration has pledged to pressure all 23 into doing so.) They tend to be younger — the Pew Research Center has found that adult unauthorized immigrants were, at the median, about a decade younger than American-born adults — and skew slightly more male than the rest of the country. Geography and demography are only two ways to anatomize these 11 million. Circumstance offers another: As he seeks to tighten law enforcement’s grip on unauthorized immigrants, Mr. Trump will grapple with a population of people who arrived in several ways and for myriad reasons, each slice presenting its own challenges. To hear many liberals and immigrant advocates tell it, most undocumented immigrants are productive, law-abiding members of society, deeply rooted in communities all over the country, working hard, living quietly, paying taxes and raising families. Statistics show that many of the undocumented fit this profile. About 60 percent of the unauthorized population has been here for at least a decade, according to the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute. 10 or more years of residence   60% 40 20 Less than 5 years Percentage of unauthorized immigrants 1996 2000 2004 2008 2012 10 or more years of residence 60% 40 20 Less than 5 years Percentage of unauthorized immigrants 1996 2000 2004 2008 2012 A third of undocumented immigrants 15 and older lives with at least one child who is a United States citizen by birth. Slightly more than 30 percent own homes. Only a tiny fraction has been convicted of felonies or serious misdemeanors. Of course, as the Trump administration has emphasized, merely being here without authorization is a violation of the law. Even the wording of the issue is revealing: conservatives favor the term ""illegal immigrants,"" which hardliners often truncate to ""illegals""; immigrant advocates prefer ""undocumented immigrants,"" a phrasing that they say prods the conversation back toward the humans in question, but that also has a whiff of euphemism. ""Unauthorized"" often shows up as a neutral alternative. No matter the label placed on them, people like Lydia, 47, who runs a small jewelry store in Los Angeles, do not think of themselves as lawbreakers. Lydia, who like several undocumented immigrants did not want her last name published for fear of being deported, crossed the border through Tijuana in 1988. She looked for legal help from a notary, mistakenly thinking that a “notario” indicates a legal expert, as it does in many Latin American countries. She was eventually ordered out of the country. But the Obama administration deprioritized deportations of people who had committed no major crimes, and it allowed her to live and work in the United States as long as she checked in with an immigration agent each year. Lydia raised four children, all citizens, and sent them to public schools in Sun Valley, a suburb north of Los Angeles. She and her husband bought a home there, paid off their mortgage and bought a second home nearby. Undocumented immigrants without U.S. born children 6 million With U.S. born children 4 2 1996 2000 2004 2008 2012 Undocumented immigrants without U.S. born children 6 million 4 With U.S. born children 2 1996 2000 2004 2008 2012 Now she is a candidate for deportation once again, and is anxious each time she steps out of her home. “I am in limbo,” she said. “I am afraid I will go out and never come back.” Few nemeses loomed larger in the narrative of Mr. Trump’s presidential campaign than the figure of the illegal immigrant who threatened Americans — one of the “rapists” and “killers” from Mexico, as Mr. Trump has put it. 820,000 have been convicted of a crime (7.5%) 11 million unauthorized immigrants 300,000 have been convicted of a felony (2.7%) 11 million unauthorized immigrants 820,000 have been convicted of a crime (7.5%) 300,000 have been convicted of a felony (2.7%) Such people do exist. The Migration Policy Institute has estimated that 820,000 of the 11 million unauthorized have been convicted of a crime. About 300,000, or less than 3 percent of the 11 million undocumented, have committed felonies. (The proportion of felons in the overall population was an estimated 6 percent in 2010, according to a paper presented to the Population Association of America.) Immigration agents regularly arrest what the government calls “criminal aliens.” At the end of January, agents arrested a 50-year-old Mexican man near Milwaukee who had felony convictions for assault with a deadly weapon, battery against a police officer, car theft and intentionally harming a child, and who had been deported twice before. Last week, they caught an undocumented Honduran man in North Carolina, Francisco Escobar-Orellana, who is wanted in Honduras for allegedly hacking two men to death with a machete in 1993. The Trump administration has said it will continue to prioritize deporting those with serious criminal records, but, in a break from the Obama administration, the new policies also take aim at immigrants whose offenses are limited to living here without permission or minor crimes that enable immigrants to work here, like driving without a license or using a fake Social Security number. The Social Security Administration estimated that in 2010, 1.8 million undocumented immigrants worked under a number that did not match their name. Surrounded by the sugar cane fields of Clewiston, Fla., working backbreaking jobs, Maria and Benjamin took pains to follow the rules, pay taxes and stay out of the way. But now they fear the one rule Benjamin had to break to survive — he used a fraudulent Social Security number to secure a job — may prove their undoing. Benjamin, 42, fixes the hydraulic trucks used for the area’s cane-cutting operation, which means he works 17 hours a day, often at night. “This worries us, but we don’t have an option,” said Maria, 38, who arrived from Mexico when she was 19. “He has always worked and has always had a fake Social Security card. That is the way you get a job.” Some people endure long journeys by foot, train, boat and smugglers to make it across the border. But for an increasing number of immigrants, illegal status arrives overnight, without a single step. In each year from 2008 to 2012, more people joined the ranks of the illegal by remaining in the United States after their temporary visitor permits expired than by creeping across the Mexican border, according to a report by researchers at the Center for Migration Studies. A partial government estimate released last year said that 416,500 people whose business or tourist visas had expired in 2015 were still in the country in 2016. That does not count people who came here on student visas or temporary worker permits. Numbers like these have convinced some conservatives that the federal government needs to worry more about people who abuse their temporary legal status than about border security. In 2005, tourist visas brought Wei Lee and his parents to San Francisco from Brazil, where Mr. Lee’s parents, who had emigrated from China, ran a restaurant outside São Paulo. They remained in the United States after the visas expired. After being mugged and beaten in 2013, Mr. Lee recently received a U visa, which is reserved for victims of crime. His parents, however, are still undocumented. “Some people misunderstand, they think people come here and overstay their visas intentionally, but there are all these push and pull factors,” said Mr. Lee, 28, a college graduate who now works with Asian undocumented youth. “My parents had to make a decision for their lives.” After the expiration of the tourist visa that Rebeca, a former television reporter from Venezuela, used to enter the United States, she found work as a nanny, then got a job as a designer at a clothing business in Southern California. Rebeca, now 30, said she had left Venezuela after being attacked and receiving death threats for protesting against the government after the death of Hugo Chávez. She has applied for asylum, but it will be years before her case is even considered: In Los Angeles, immigration officials are currently scheduling hearings for people who first applied in 2011. One reason Mr. Trump and many proponents of curbing immigration see the Mexican border as alarmingly porous is that thousands of people each year are convicted of illegally re-entering the country after being previously deported. In the 2015 fiscal year alone, 15,715 were convicted, according to the United States Sentencing Commission. About a quarter of people caught crossing the southwest border that year had done it at least once before, according to a Government Accountability Office report. That said, the number of people convicted of illegal re-entry has declined by more than a quarter over the last five years. 2011 21,300 2012 19,300 2013 18,500 2014 16,600 2015 15,700 2011 21,300 2012 19,300 2013 18,500 2014 16,600 2015 15,700 In December 2013, border security agents caught Clemente Armenta-Velasquez trying to return to the United States near Nogales, Ariz. After arriving in the United States in 2000, he had lived and worked in Arizona, where, records show, he was prosecuted on drug charges in 2002. He also served time in prison after being convicted of possession with intent to distribute marijuana, a felony, in 2010. He was deported the following year. Mr. Armenta-Velasquez’s lawyer told a federal judge that his client, who had left school after fifth grade, had tried to come back to support his wife and three children in Mexico. “He couldn’t find a job in Mexico that would give a decent life for his family,” said the lawyer, Ricardo Bours, according to court papers. Before sentencing Mr. Armenta-Velasquez to 57 months in prison, after which he will almost certainly be sent back to Mexico again, the judge suggested that Mr. Armenta-Velasquez might have been ordered deported as many as six times in the past. “I knew I wasn’t supposed to” return, Mr. Armenta-Velasquez said in court. “I did it out of great need, but I apologize for that.” On Valentine’s Day, Rogelio Ortiz stopped by the local immigration office in Charlotte, N.C., to update his family’s address. He was seeking asylum in the United States after arriving from Honduras last February, fleeing arms traffickers who threatened him after he asked them to stop storing weapons in his brother’s house. Fifteen minutes later, an officer came out to tell Mr. Ortiz’s wife, Teresa, and daughter, Abigail, that he had been detained. Without realizing it, Mr. Ortiz, 49, had already lost his asylum case: He had been deported 14 years ago after a previous stint working in the United States, and was ineligible. Since 2009, migrants seeking asylum from Mexico and Central America’s Northern Triangle region — Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala — have surged across the border at a relentless pace, fleeing gang violence and poverty. Many of them are children traveling alone or women with children. Nearly 409,000 migrants were caught trying to cross the United States’ southwestern border illegally in the 2016 fiscal year, an increase of 23 percent over the previous year, according to government statistics. Many ask for asylum, but in most cases, the requests are denied. While they wait, a process that can take years to conclude, they are often released to move freely into the country. That can mean disappearing beyond the reach of immigration officials. The system has infuriated those who advocate tougher enforcement, prompting the Trump administration to propose detaining asylum seekers at the border or forcing them to wait it out in Mexico. “I know coming into the country illegally is a crime, but millions of people have done it, and now we come here asking for help,” Teresa said. Now she seeks work to pay for a plane ticket. Teresa plans to renounce her own asylum claims to reunite, once again, with her husband — this time, back in Honduras.",news

2023,ASCAP and Radio Group's 5-Year Pact Doesn't Address the Elephant in the Room,"ASCAP and the Radio Music License Committee (RMLC) announced in mid-December that they had reached a deal whereby the performance rights organization will issue a blanket license from 2017 through 2021, setting rates payable by over 10,000 U.S. terrestrial radio stations. The deal provides for rate increases during the five-year term, but further details were not disclosed. Sources suggest to Billboard, however, that ASCAP had been getting 1.7 percent of revenue in the prior deal; and the new arrangement starts at 1.73 percent of revenue and escalates to 1.75 percent of revenue over the life of the deal. This is good news because it means that ASCAP not only got a rate increase but did so without getting involved in a costly and protracted rate trial. But the really interesting part of the announcement is a reference stating the license ""expressly affirms the percentage share of radio performance represented by ASCAP's"" catalog. It further claims this is the first time ever that a blanket license deal has included that ingredient. Why that's interesting will become clear in a minute. Another really interesting aspect of the deal's announcement is what it doesn't say. Nowhere in the press release is the biggest issue of the day facing both ASCAP and BMI: the DOJ's interpretation that the consent decrees imposes full works licensing on them. While BMI's rate court judge ruled against the DOJ that BMI can do fractional licensing if it so chooses (the DOJ has appealed), the DOJ's interpretation still stands for ASCAP. What is the difference between full-works versus fractional licensing? If there is a song with four songwriters -- each a member of a different PRO, be it ASCAP, BMI, SESAC or GMR (Global Music Rights) -- full-work licensing means you only need a license from one of those PROs. In fractional licensing, a music user would need a license from all four PRO's as each one would only license their share of the song. After the DOJ handed down its interpretation, the PROs and publishers said the full-works decision opened up a Pandora's box of issues that haven't been thought through, including how one PRO would pay a songwriter from another PRO, as required by regulation. Since it's a direct negotiated deal, the two parties likely don't have to abide by the DOJ interpretation. ASCAP declined to comment on whether full-works or fractional licensing is used in the deal, or any other aspect of the deal; while the RMLC has not yet responded to a request for comment made on Dec. 23. If the deal encompasses full-works licensing, how does the agreement treat songs written by songwriters that are not in ASCAP? One possible hint to that answer is back to the earlier-mentioned part of the press release noting that this deal is the first time a blanket licensing deal also included mathematically determined—but publicly undisclosed—market share for radio performance represented by ASCAP's catalog. That market share assignment may serve multiple purposes. For one, it could allow the RMLC to claim that the blanket license it received from ASCAP is a full-works license, but the market share assignment gives BMI a way to pay on a fractional license basis, the way the industry has traditionally worked. That means the RMLC could assign market share to each of the other PROs for their share of overall plays, too. This mechanism would insure that all songwriters get paid, even if it doesn't take away the legal risk assigned by the regulation, which says that the licensor in full works licensing is responsible for paying the other songwriters. What else does the market share assignment do? In the past, it has traditionally been assumed that ASCAP has 45 percent market share, BMI has 45 percent market share and everyone else has 10 percent market share. This would be the first time that an actual mathematically measured market share, based on percentage of plays that a PRO's songwriters collectively tally in a certain period, is actually tied to an actual rate. That could allow for bonuses to ASCAP or discounts for the RMLC, if the five year deal is cut up into one-year periods. If ASCAP songwriters have a hot year and the PRO gets a bigger market share, then the PRO could get more money by some agreed-upon formula. Conversely, if ASCAP writers go cold during one year, then the RMLC could receive a discount. Moreover, the RMLC could potentially derive another huge benefit out of the assignment of market shares: it could provide another mechanism in setting rates for all the other PROs. This benefit would not come into play in deals where the two sides successfully negotiate a deal that sets rates. But that happens if the RMLC can't reach a deal with another PRO. If the other PRO is Global Music Rights, this mechanism would not come into play because GMR is not under any mandate to abide by arbitration or go to rate court. Let's leave GMR aside until the antitrust suits that GMR and RMLC have filed against each other are resolved. But what happens if BMI and SESAC fail to reach a negotiated rate with the RMLC. If it's BMI, then it's off to BMI rate court, per the consent decree. If SESAC, it's off to arbitration because that PRO agreed to that process as part of a settlement in the RMLC's antitrust suit at the end of 2015. In arbitration and in rate court, a mathematically researched market share assignment to either SESAC or BMI could likely play a role in determining what rate is paid to them -- if it can get the judge or arbitrator to go along. All that would need to be done is the mathematical assignment of market share based on plays for ASCAP, BMI, SESAC and GMR. How will those market shares be applied in a rate setting determination? Remember, a few years back, Pandora was seeking licenses from both ASCAP and BMI and wound up in rate court for both. At the time, both PROs were assumed to each have 45 percent share, and everyone else had 10 percent. But even though ASCAP and BMI were thought to be the same size, the ASCAP rate court Judge Denise Cote ruled that Pandora should pay ASCAP 1.85 percent of revenue while the BMI rate court Judge Louis Stanton ruled that Pandora should pay 2.5 percent or revenue to BMI. The BMI rate court judge found a way to justify BMI's higher rate, when they were both considered the same size. But could the Judge give a higher market share, if it was mathematically proven that one PRO was larger than the other, at least in terms of market share plays? Since ASCAP was the first one in to agree to having market share assigned to it, it probably likes what the mathematically researched market share showed. If that's the case, and if the RMLC can get the mathematically proven market share concept introduced in rate court and arbitration, it could box in the rate determination for BMI and SESAC, some music publishing executives speculate, and thus keep the RMLC's overall rate down. In fact, as this story was being published, BMI issued a press release denouncing the radio airplay market share assigned to it by the RMLC; and saying it was headed to rate court because it can’t negotiate a deal, based on the RMLC proposal. ""The RMLC has proposed an interim rate well below BMI's previous deal, the effect of which would have a significant impact on the royalties BMI pays to its songwriters, composers and music publishers,"" according to the BMI statement. ""The RMLC has justified its proposed rate based upon incomplete and incorrect information regarding BMI's radio performances. BMI disagrees fundamentally with the RMLC’s proposal and, consistent with past practices, is asking the Court to maintain its most recent rate while new terms are negotiated."" (Check back later today for a follow-up story on this.) ""RMLC has a rate in mind for the entire industry and this market share mechanism may help them establish that,"" speculates one music publishing exec. ""They don't care how their payments to songwriters are divided up among the PROs, as long as they can establish a mechanism that helps them contain overall payments."" UPDATE 1:46 PM: This article was updated to include a statement regarding BMI's legal action against the RMLC.",clickbait
2804,Nothing Will Redeem the Ruined Reputations of Trump’s Republican Collaborators,"Donald Trump’s distinctive rhetorical style — think of a drunk with a bullhorn reading aloud James Joyce’s Finnegans Wake under water — poses an almost insuperable challenge to people whose painful duty is to try to extract clarity from his effusions. For example, last week, during a long stream of in Fort Worth, this man who as president would nominate members of the federal judiciary vowed to “open up” libel laws to make it easier to sue — to intimidate and punish — people who write “negative” things. Well. Trump, the tough guy, resembles a campus crybaby who has wandered out of his “safe space. ” It is not news that he has neither respect for nor knowledge of the Constitution, and he probably is unaware that he would have to “open up” many Supreme Court First Amendment rulings in order to achieve his aim. His obvious aim is to chill free speech, for the comfort of the political class, of which he is now a gaudy ornament. RELATED: Trump vs. the First Amendment, The night before his promise to make America great again through censorship, Trump, during the Houston debate, said that his sister, a federal judge, signed “a certain bill” and that Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito also “signed that bill. ” So, the leading Republican candidate, the breadth of whose ignorance is the eighth wonder of the world, actually thinks that judges “sign bills. ” Trump is a presidential aspirant who would flunk an civics exam. Share article on FacebookshareTweet Unfortunately, Rubio recognized reality and found his voice 254 days after Trump’s scabrous announcement of his candidacy to rescue America from Mexican rapists. And 222 days after Trump disparaged John McCain’s war service (“I like people that weren’t captured”). And 95 days after Trump said that maybe a protester at his rally “should have been roughed up. ” And 95 days after Trump that 81 percent of white murder victims are killed by blacks. ( percent are killed by whites.) And 94 days after Trump said he supports torture “even if it doesn’t work. ” And 79 days after Trump said he might have approved the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II. And 72 days after Trump proved that he does not know the nuclear triad from the Nutcracker ballet. And 70 days after Trump, having been praised by Vladimir Putin, reciprocated by praising the Russian murderer and dictator. And so on. RELATED: Trump, the Insult Comic Candidate, Rubio’s epiphany — announcing the obvious with a sense of triumphant discovery — about Trump being a “con man” and a “clown act” is better eight months late than never. If, however, it is too late to rescue Rubio from a Trump nomination, this will be condign punishment for him and the rest of the Republican party’s coalition of the timid. “Once to every man and nation, comes the moment to decide, In the strife of truth with falsehood, for the good or evil side. ” So begins James Russell Lowell’s 1845 poem protesting America’s war with Mexico. The Republicans’ moment is here. We are about to learn much about Republican officeholders who are now deciding whether to come to terms with Trump, and with the shattering of their party as a vessel of conservatism. Trump’s collaborators, like the remarkably plastic Chris Christie (“I don’t think [Trump’s] temperament is suited for [the presidency]”) will find that nothing will redeem the reputations they will ruin by placing their opportunism in the service of his demagogic cynicism and authoritarianism.,",news

According to a Legally India report, footwear giant Bata has slapped legal notices on the makers and actors of Jolly LLB 2 for projecting the brand in a bad light. A recent Deccan Chronicle report claims that the brand has sent a  legal notice to Fox Star Studios, executive producer Naren Kumar, directors Deepak Jacob, Amit Shah and Subhash Kapoor, actors Annu Kapoor and Akshay Kumar, YouTube, PVR Cinemas and Satyam Cineplexes. In one of the scenes from the trailer, Annu Kapoor tells Akshay Kumar,  ""Varna Kya….BATA ka joota pehan kar, tuchhi si terricot ki shirt pehan kar, saala humse zabaan lada rahe hain"" As per the report by Deccan Chronicle, the petition states, ""The dialogue is intended to convey that the brand BATA is adorned only by lower strata of society and one should feel humiliated if one wears BATA footwear, in fact the expression and reaction to such a dialogue by Akshay Kumar in the trailer shows that even the person to whom such a statement is hurled took the same extremely negatively and slapped Annu Kapoor in Open Court as if he has been severely abused in the dialogue or he has been hurled with deliberate effort to tarnish the brand image of Bata, “perhaps at the instance of some competitors of [Bata] whose products are promoted by Mr Akshay Kumar as a brand ambassador."" Bata has asked for a personal apology as well as an apology published in mainstream national newspapers. Further, they also want them to pull down the 'allegedly' derogatory trailer and publish a prominent apology on all versions of its trailer, for damaging the reputation of Bata. Just to jog your memory a little, Salman Khan starrer Dabangg had also faced a similar controversy when the healthcare brand Emami had sued them for depicting their product Zandu Balm in a derogatory light. What followed was a mutual out of court settlement after which Arbaaz Khan's wife and fellow co-producer of the film Malaika Arora Khan was signed in as a brand ambassador of the lotion.

290,Caught tech-handed: The criminals snared by their own stupidity,"Share this with Email Facebook Messenger Messenger Twitter Pinterest WhatsApp LinkedIn Copy this link These are external links and will open in a new window The US man charged with his wife's murder based on data from her Fitbit device shows how suspects are not only exploiting technology but increasingly being snared by it too. Here are some more examples of how technology has led police to suspects and how criminals have fallen victim to their own stupidity, ignorance and vanity. A thief who stole more than 100 smartphones at a music festival was detained after revellers with iPhones tracked them using an app that comes with the phone. The Find My iPhone app shows the device's location on laptops or other devices. Reinaldo De Jesus Henao, 36, was arrested at the Coachella festival in California earlier this month. Police had already dedicated extra resources to Coachella after ""chatter on social media"" about missing iPhones, Sgt Dan Marshall told tech news site Gizmodo. Several phones were returned immediately, Indio Police added, while the rest were handed to lost property at the festival site. In 2011, police in California recovered a stolen laptop after being handed clues to its whereabouts along with pictures of a suspect thanks to a stealth software program. Cab driver Muthanna Aldebashi, 27, was snapped on the Mac device's built-in camera after he powered it up. The Mac's rightful owner Joshua Kaufman, an Oakland interaction designer, had installed software called Hidden, which supplies the computer's location, photographs taken on the Mac's internal camera and shots of the Mac's screen display. The program immediately began sending Mr Kaufman photographs of a bearded man with shaggy dark hair sleeping on a couch, sitting shirtless on a bed in front of the computer, and driving. The software also sent Mr Kaufman - who has blogged about the theft - a screen shot showing the man logging into his own e-mail account - information investigators later used to lure him into an arrest. Thieves who steal electronic devices can find themselves literally facing justice simply by using them. There have been numerous reports of stolen smartphones and laptops being recovered after photos taken on devices are automatically uploaded to the owner's iCloud account. In 2015 Randy Schaefer had an iPad, a laptop and some cash stolen from his truck parked in Houston, Texas. The thieves gloated by taking selfies and recording themselves with their booty. When checking his iCloud account moments later, Mr Schaefer discovered more than a dozen pictures and video of the suspects - who said they were ""just hustling"" - with their mouths full of $100 notes. He uploaded the content and handed the evidence to police, who later arrested the two men, according to local media. A cyclist robbed at gunpoint by three men in South Africa in 2014 caught the entire episode on a camera strapped to his head - and the thieves failed to notice. Malcolm Fox handed over his possessions, including his smartphone, car keys, designer Oakley sunglasses and bike, after he was approached by a man with a gun and then ""frisked"" by another man with a knife. However, none of the men seemed to have any idea of the importance of Mr Fox's GoPro camera, which they appeared to investigate and stare at but were uninterested in taking. Mr Fox, who was approached by the men after taking a wrong turn while cycling in Somerset West, later shared the dramatic footage on YouTube. The suspects were later arrested and Mr Fox's mobile phone and bike were returned, according to reports. Twitter is all about encouraging followers - and that is exactly what happened when an armed man on the run from police in Chicago began live-tweeting the chase and posted the location where he was hiding. Brandon McNeil, 21, was found in a basement by officers who discovered his social media boasts. ""Lol look I just left the police they lookin fa me,"" he tweeted during the 2016 chase, adding: ""Here's my hiding spot."" McNeil also posted a photo of a gun, police records show, and the location of a home where he had chosen to hide. He was arrested shortly afterwards when officers contacted the homeowner, police said. Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn clash as they set out their views of the election choice.",clickbait

604,Turkey-Netherlands row: Dutch warn citizens after Erdogan threat,"Share this with Email Facebook Messenger Messenger Twitter Pinterest WhatsApp LinkedIn Copy this link These are external links and will open in a new window The Netherlands has warned its citizens over travel to Turkey as a row between the countries shows no sign of abating. Germany, Austria and the Netherlands blocked Turkish attempts to hold rallies in those countries. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan vowed retaliation, accusing them of ""Nazism"". On Monday, the Dutch foreign ministry issued a new travel warning, urging its citizens in Turkey to take care and noting the new ""diplomatic tensions"". The warning to ""avoid gatherings and crowded places"" came as Turkey's foreign ministry lodged a formal protest with the Dutch envoy. Meanwhile, the Dutch deputy prime minister, Lodewijk Asscher, said that ""to be called Nazis by a regime which is walking backwards in regards to human rights is just disgusting"". The BBC's Mark Lowen, in Istanbul, said the two Nato allies were now locked in an ""unprecedented diplomatic crisis"". The proposed rallies aimed to encourage a large number of Turks living in Europe to vote Yes in a referendum on 16 April on expanding the president's powers. The plans were criticised by senior EU officials on Monday. In Germany, for example, there are more than three million people of Turkish origin, of whom an estimated 1.4m are eligible to vote in Turkish elections. In effect, the diaspora is Turkey's fourth-largest electoral district. Planned rallies in Germany, Austria and the Netherlands were blocked after officials cited security concerns or said the rallies could stoke tensions. A gathering in France went ahead, however, after officials said it did not pose a threat. Two Turkish ministers were barred from addressing rallies in the Dutch city of Rotterdam, with one of them escorted to the German border. Police used dogs and water cannon against protesters waving Turkish flags in Rotterdam. Mr Erdogan likened the Netherlands to ""a banana republic"", demanded international organisations impose sanctions on the Netherlands, and accused countries in the West of ""Islamophobia"". ""I have said that I had thought that Nazism was over, but I was wrong. Nazism is alive in the West,"" he added. He warned that countries would ""pay the price"" for their actions. On Monday morning, Turkey summoned the Dutch charge d'affaires in Ankara for the third time in three days. He was handed two notes, protesting against the treatment of the minister escorted to Germany, and the treatment of protesters in Rotterdam. Dutch PM Mark Rutte called Mr Erdogan's comments ""unacceptable"", and demanded an apology. The pressure from Turkey comes days before the Dutch election, in which Mr Rutte is facing pressure from anti-Islam candidate Geert Wilders. Germany's foreign minister said he hoped Turkey would ""return to its senses"". Chancellor Angela Merkel has said her government is not opposed to Turkish ministers attending rallies in Germany, as long as they are ""duly announced"". At a news conference on Monday, she said the Nazi comparisons were ""completely unacceptable"" and that the Netherlands had her full support. Danish Prime Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen said he had postponed a meeting later this month with Turkish Prime Minister Binali Yildirim because ""with the current Turkish attacks on Holland the meeting cannot be seen separated from that"". He said he was concerned that ""democratic principles are under great pressure"" in Turkey. Scotland's first minister says she will ask for permission to hold a second vote on independence.",news

916,Breakthrough in dementia campaign as ex-players commit to medical research while FA prepares to launch study,"The Independent understands that a Football Association-commissioned research project is expected to be under way by the end of the year Scores of retired footballers have come forward to pledge the donation of their brains to dementia research, amid signs that the campaign for a clinical investigation into the neurological effects of heading are moving towards a breakthrough at last.  A total of 20 former professional and amateur players have contacted the Jeff Astle Trust, which is leading the campaign, in the last two days alone, and many in touch with the group are willing to be organ donors. The Trust's contact with families provide the Football Association with a potentially crucial resource, as the examination of deceased players brains is the most effective and conclusive way of establishing - or discounting - a link between football and dementia. But The Independent understands that a Football Association-commissioned research project is also expected to be under way by the end of the year. Expert consultants approached by the FA have been at odds over what information the research project needs to secure and how the commissioning brief should be formulated. But after months of work seeking consensus, the governing body is thought to be reaching agreement on the research parameters. The FA-commissioned work could be a two or three-year project, with authors of a paper which revealed evidence of damage consistent with heading or other collisions in the brains of six deceased players insisting that a more detailed investigation is now needed. Dawn Astle, the daughter of Jeff Astle, said on Thursday night that her group had not been approached by the FA about acting as a link to prospective donors but that they were willing to help in any way possible. Many of the families who have approached the Trust say that ex-players with dementia developed the condition in their 60s, at an age younger than is typical in the general population. The need for urgent investigation was underlined on Thursday when the chief executive of the Professional Footballers’ Association, Gordon Taylor, told the BBC that children under the age of ten should nor head the ball until a better scientific understanding of the impact was established. Taylor told the Today programme: “The game needs to look at regular testing as it has done with heart screening. In the meantime, it’s no bad thing for youngster under the age of ten not to head the ball… bearing in mind they are not fully developed.” Ms Astle sees the FA-commissioned project as the essential piece of work, though she said the Trust reserved judgement on work beginning this year, as her family had been promised an investigation before in the 15 years since a post mortem found that her father’s dementia had also been caused by heading a football. “Let’s hope something can get under way this time,” said Ms Astle. “We have had so many empty promises and have always felt the football authorities do not want to investigate because of what they might find. We know football has got the money to investigate but does it have the will?” In the short term, Uefa has said it will begin undertaking a research project on Friday, in which it will count the number of times children head the ball in games and training sessions. That exercise will provide scientists undertaking clinical research with a valuable sense of how often repeated ‘impacts’ are taking place. Stiles' plight with dementia has raised awareness of the condition in footballers (Getty) More than 1,000 children will be filmed across two age ranges, eight-12 and 14-16, and the headers will be logged and categorised. The project will also track the number of headers by players in different positions on the field. The breakthroughs come after the publication of the most detailed British research ever undertaken into dementia among retired footballers concluded that the condition may be connected to repeated head ‘impacts’, caused by collisions and thousands of headers. The Swansea University/UCL study included post mortem examinations on six players who suffered dementia, which revealed that all of them had suffered from a tearing to a brain membrane consistent with chronic, repetitive head impacts from playing football. The incidence of that tearing in the general population is just six per cent, based on previous studies.",news

1099,Beyond Hennessy: Get Fancy With These Five Cognacs,"Experience a different amber spirit this year. For most of the mid- to late Aughts, cognac producers concentrated their marketing dollars on China’s ballooning middle class. But with a greater emphasis on personal austerity—along with a new suite of anticorruption laws—killing demand for high-end gifts there, those producers are turning to the U.S., where we can’t seem to consume enough brown spirits: There were 4.7 million cases of cognac sold here in 2015, and that number is expected to reach 5 million this year. Some bottles can get pricey (Tesseron sells one for $1,200), but don’t let that deter you from gifting an option not so insanely expensive—a little austerity certainly can’t hurt. This light, golden cognac is made from grapes grown on the chateau’s estate, located in Petite Champagne, one of the six subregions (or crus) of Cognac. Did you know there are only about a dozen such grower-producers in the world? Probably not, but now you have an excellent tidbit to drop at cocktail parties. Cognac for the Scotch lover: Its aromas of leather, mushroom, and vanilla will be familiar to anyone with a soft spot for Macallan. All 40-plus eaux de vie in this cognac are from Grande Champagne, the most highly regarded cru, and each is aged at least 20 years before blending. Martell, the world’s oldest cognac house, is learning new tricks. These include finishing its latest release in bourbon barrels, which adds vanilla and coconut aromas to a typically fruity profile. VSOP? Please—Tesseron doesn’t bother selling anything younger than an XO. This one’s a blend of 30 eaux de vie, resulting in a spicy, floral spirit. What is cognac, exactly? Short answer: It’s brandy made in France’s Cognac region. And what is brandy? It’s an amber spirit produced from a blend of eaux de vie wines distilled from grapes and aged for at least two years. All cognacs are brandies, but not all brandies are cognacs. What do the letters on the labels mean? VS (very special): Barrel-aged for a minimum of two years, these tend to be lighter and less complex. VSOP (very superior old pale): These are aged for a minimum of four years and are darker and more concentrated as a result. XO (extra old): Prior to 2016, these were aged for a minimum of six years; now it’s a minimum of 10. Also known as Napoleon cognacs, they’re the most sophisticated and complex out there.

That story started a year ago, when the Natural Environment Research Council, a British government agency, opened a public campaign to name a ship to replace the James Clark Ross. That plan backfired in spectacular fashion, with voters overwhelmingly supporting a name that failed to capture the grandeur that officials were probably looking for: Boaty McBoatface. To the dismay of many, the Science Ministry ignored the results of the poll and announced that the ship would be named after the naturalist David Attenborough. In an attempt to soothe hurt feelings, British officials acknowledged the Boaty McBoatface phenomenon by bestowing the name on a remotely operated submarine that would accompany the David Attenborough in collecting data and samples. Enthusiasm for Boaty McBoatface continued to run high on Monday, even though, as one Twitter user noted, it’s not a boat, and it doesn’t have a face. Good luck to Boaty McBoatface on its first voyage! - still laughing at the name after all this time Bon voyage, Boaty https://t.co/D1KylI5QD2 pic.twitter.com/62boVvAIIZ The robot submarine’s missions can last for several months and include traveling thousands of miles under ice while reaching depths of about three and a half miles to measure seabed properties on an oceanic scale. The submarine can then rise to the surface to transmit data to oceanographers via a radio link. The British National Oceanography Center says it hopes Boaty will be able to make the first under-ice crossing of the Arctic Ocean. Construction of the David Attenborough, a project expected to cost 200 million pounds, or about $240 million, continues at a shipyard in Liverpool, in northern England. The vessel is expected to become operational in 2019.",news
2488,,The true sign of progress will be that everyone has a bit more freedom to decide how many hours per week they work. In order for that to happen the job market needs to become a lot more liquid. That will happen when needed benefits like health insurance and basic income are met by the government and most people are able to work on a freelance or contract basis and are able to take time off in between jobs without so much risk because they are not dependent on a specific employer. I don't think 25 hours will necessarily be the standard so much as I think that there won't really be a standard that everyone is expected to adhere to anymore. 40 hours is totally arbitrary in a way that smacks of Communism.,other

821,How Republics End ,"Many people are reacting to the rise of Trumpism and nativist movements in Europe by reading history — specifically, the history of the 1930s. And they are right to do so. It takes willful blindness not to see the parallels between the rise of fascism and our current political nightmare. But the ’30s isn’t the only era with lessons to teach us. Lately I’ve been reading a lot about the ancient world. Initially, I have to admit, I was doing it for entertainment and as a refuge from news that gets worse with each passing day. But I couldn’t help noticing the contemporary resonances of some Roman history — specifically, the tale of how the Roman Republic fell. Here’s what I learned: Republican institutions don’t protect against tyranny when powerful people start defying political norms. And tyranny, when it comes, can flourish even while maintaining a republican facade. On the first point: Roman politics involved fierce competition among ambitious men. But for centuries that competition was constrained by some seemingly unbreakable rules. Here’s what Adrian Goldsworthy’s “In the Name of Rome” says: “However important it was for an individual to win fame and add to his and his family’s reputation, this should always be subordinated to the good of the Republic … no disappointed Roman politician sought the aid of a foreign power.” America used to be like that, with prominent senators declaring that we must stop “partisan politics at the water’s edge.” But now we have a president-elect who openly asked Russia to help smear his opponent, and all indications are that the bulk of his party was and is just fine with that. (A new poll shows that Republican approval of Vladimir Putin has surged even though — or, more likely, precisely because — it has become clear that Russian intervention played an important role in the U.S. election.) Winning domestic political struggles is all that matters, the good of the republic be damned. And what happens to the republic as a result? Famously, on paper the transformation of Rome from republic to empire never happened. Officially, imperial Rome was still ruled by a Senate that just happened to defer to the emperor, whose title originally just meant “commander,” on everything that mattered. We may not go down exactly the same route — although are we even sure of that? — but the process of destroying democratic substance while preserving forms is already underway. Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world. Consider what just happened in North Carolina. The voters made a clear choice, electing a Democratic governor. The Republican legislature didn’t openly overturn the result — not this time, anyway — but it effectively stripped the governor’s office of power, ensuring that the will of the voters wouldn’t actually matter. Combine this sort of thing with continuing efforts to disenfranchise or at least discourage voting by minority groups, and you have the potential making of a de facto one-party state: one that maintains the fiction of democracy, but has rigged the game so that the other side can never win. Why is this happening? I’m not asking why white working-class voters support politicians whose policies will hurt them — I’ll be coming back to that issue in future columns. My question, instead, is why one party’s politicians and officials no longer seem to care about what we used to think were essential American values. And let’s be clear: This is a Republican story, not a case of “both sides do it.” So what’s driving this story? I don’t think it’s truly ideological. Supposedly free-market politicians are already discovering that crony capitalism is fine as long as it involves the right cronies. It does have to do with class warfare — redistribution from the poor and the middle class to the wealthy is a consistent theme of all modern Republican policies. But what directly drives the attack on democracy, I’d argue, is simple careerism on the part of people who are apparatchiks within a system insulated from outside pressures by gerrymandered districts, unshakable partisan loyalty, and lots and lots of plutocratic financial support. For such people, toeing the party line and defending the party’s rule are all that matters. And if they sometimes seem consumed with rage at anyone who challenges their actions, well, that’s how hacks always respond when called on their hackery. One thing all of this makes clear is that the sickness of American politics didn’t begin with Donald Trump, any more than the sickness of the Roman Republic began with Caesar. The erosion of democratic foundations has been underway for decades, and there’s no guarantee that we will ever be able to recover. But if there is any hope of redemption, it will have to begin with a clear recognition of how bad things are. American democracy is very much on the edge.",clickbait
3509,Andy Murray: rising prize money should trickle down to lower ranked players,"The £50, 000 Marcus Willis collected in two matches at Wimbledon this week sounds like the sort of money that would encourage young players across the country to rush to their nearest tennis club and start swinging a racket. The reality, as Willis and Andy Murray know, is somewhat different. Murray, the world No2, has just been voted on to the ATP players’ council and hopes he can do some good for players on the outer fringes of the game. As he prepared for his match against the world No76 Lu — who embarrassed him at the Beijing Olympics in 2008 — Murray reflected on the dilemma facing the Willis, No772 in the world, as well as other British players such as Liam Broady, whom he defeated in three sets on Tuesday. “The first thing is we need to improve the prize money at Futures level,” Murray said of the lowest rung of men’s professional tennis. “I think it’s stayed the same since the 1980s, but the cost of everything has gone up massively since then, so it’s impossible to stay at that level for more than a couple of years. ” Willis revealed that he returned from his last proper tournament, in Tunisia in January, with just €60. “You are losing money unless you are winning each week,” Murray added. “So, for the guys that are stuck there for a couple of years, playing and you simply cannot fund your career that way. “The first thing is you have to improve the prize money at the lowest level. It’s been going up everywhere else, at the top of the game, massively. But that hasn’t filtered down to the bottom of the game. That’s something that needs to change. ” Was there a danger, then, that talented players could disappear under the radar? Murray was unequivocal. “Players are breaking through later than they ever were before, they are finding ways to hang around. A lot of the guys play club tennis [as Willis does, in Germany and France] to try to make some extra money, which helps. We don’t have that in this country. You can travel to Europe and do that. In Spain they have a few more money tournaments. “Someone like Marcus, if he had lost in the at Wimbledon, we wouldn’t have this unbelievable story and he might not be coming back to play [on the Tour] in January. You never know. “There has to be more money at the bottom of the game. Some of the $10, 000 tournaments, they have a qualifying draw and it’s $30 to enter the qualifying. That’s a lot of money that doesn’t go to the players. The players at that level really need the money. ” That said, Murray will not be gifting Lu £80, 000 here on Thursday to advance into the third round. Murray has started at a great lick, beating Broady in just an hour and 42 minutes, and needs another quick win to settle into the tournament — unlike his slow start to the French Open last week. And he has the incentive of getting square for losing to Lu in in Beijing, when he got caught up in the euphoria of the occasion. That will not happen in Rio, he promised. “I learned that I was there to play tennis and not just enjoy being part of the Olympics. I turned up late because I had won Cincinnati. I did the opening ceremony and I was hanging out with a lot of the other athletes, stayed in the village. It was great, a great experience. But, when I lost, I was gutted. I realised that my job at the Olympics is to try to win a medal for the country. ” That is the main reason he will stay with his team away from the village this time. “Yeah, and I don’t know what the accommodation is like either. “Ideally you would go to the opening ceremony and stay in the Olympic Village. But that didn’t work for me in Beijing. At the Olympics in London, I stayed at home. I was just a lot more focused and in my own little bubble. It was one of the best weeks of my life, so I’m not going to change that this time. ” Murray and his Taiwanese opponent have other history, which is more encouraging for the Scot: each time he has played Lu in a Tour event or slam, he has gone on to win it, here in 2013 and at Queen’s last year. “I didn’t remember that I played him last year,” he said. “I’m not superstitious like that. ”",news

3023,Iraqis want crackdown on ’sleeper cells’ after huge Baghdad bomb,"The death toll from a suicide bombing in a Baghdad shopping district rose above 175 on Monday, fueling calls for security forces to crack down on Islamic State sleeper cells blamed for one of the single bombings in Iraq. Numbers rose as bodies were recovered from the rubble in the Karrada area of Baghdad, where a refrigerator truck packed with explosives blew up on Saturday night when people were out celebrating the holy month of Ramadan. to see the location of the blast By Monday evening, the toll in Karrada stood at 175 killed and 200 wounded, according to police and medical sources. Rescuers and families were still looking for 37 missing people. Islamic State claimed the bombing, its deadliest in Iraq, saying it was a suicide attack. Another explosion struck the same night, when a roadside bomb blew up in popular market of a Shi’ite district in north Baghdad, killing two people. The attacks showed Islamic State can still strike in the heart of the Iraqi capital despite recent military losses, undermining Prime Minister Haider ’s declaration of victory last month when Iraqi forces dislodged the hardline Sunni insurgents from the nearby city of Falluja. Abadi’s Shi’ government ordered the offensive on Falluja in May after a series of deadly bombings in Shi’ite areas of Baghdad that it said originated from the Sunni Muslim city, about 50 km (30 miles) west of the capital. Falluja was the first Iraqi city captured by Islamic State in 2014, six months before it declared a caliphate over parts of Iraq and Syria. Since last year the insurgents have been losing ground to U. S. Iraqi government forces and Shi’ite militias. ”Abadi has to have a meeting with the heads of national security, intelligence, the interior ministry and all sides responsible for security and ask them just one question: How can we infiltrate these groups?” said Abdul Kareem Khalaf, a former police Major General who advises the European Centre for Counterterrorism and Intelligence Studies think tank. He said Islamic State, or Daesh, ”has supporters or members everywhere in Baghdad, Basra and Kurdistan. All it takes is for one house to have at least one man and you have a planning base and launch site for attacks of this type.” In a sign of public outrage at the failure of the security services, Abadi was given an angry reception on Sunday when he toured Karrada, the district where he grew up, with residents throwing stones, empty buckets and even slippers at his convoy in gestures of contempt. He ordered new measures to protect Baghdad, starting with the withdrawal of fake bomb detectors that police have continued to use despite a scandal that broke out in 2011 about their sale to Iraq under his predecessor, Nuri . The devices were initially developed to find lost golf balls, and the British businessman who sold them to Iraq for $40 million was jailed in Britain in 2013. Abadi ordered that the fake devices be replaced by efficient detectors at the entrances to Baghdad and Iraq’s provinces. Later on Monday, the justice ministry announced in a statement that five people convicted of terrorism and sentenced to death were executed on Monday morning, bringing the total number of those executed on the same charges to 37 in the past two months. ”We refuse categorically all political or international interventions to stop the death sentence under the cover of human rights; Iraqi blood is above all slogans,” it said, linking the timing of the executions to the Karrada bombing. Iraqi intelligence services also announced on Monday the arrest of 40 ”terrorists” suspected of forming a group to carry out attacks in Baghdad and the eastern Diyala province. BUSY STREETS Karrada, a largely Shi’ite district with a small Christian community and a few Sunni mosques, was busy at the time of the blast as people were eating out and shopping late during Ramadan, which ends this week with the Eid festival. As Iraq started observing three days of national mourning, rescuers continued digging through the rubble of a shopping mall believed to be the main target of the bombing, searching for bodies or possible survivors. Three bodies were pulled out in the morning from the basement of the mall, which was reduced to a skeleton of charred steel and concrete by the blast. Its glass facades were blown out and its internal divider walls collapsed. Dozens of people gathered outside, many of them friends or relatives of missing. ”I know my nephew is here because he called me to say he can’t leave because of the fire in the building,” said Mohammed watching the rescuers at work. ”As Daesh retreats, it will shrink from state and terrorist group to just terrorist group,” said security analyst Hisham author of ”The World of Daesh”. That will require an increased response from intelligence and security services, he said, as well as cooperation from Iraq’s Sunni Muslims, who have complained of marginalization since the 2003 U. S. invasion to topple Saddam Hussein. ”Their input would be of utmost importance to unmask sleeper cells that could be operating from their areas,” Hashimi said.

1302,What the Rules Are on Flying With a Gun ,"Today's shooting at the Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport has many asking whether it's legal to travel with a firearm after it was reported that the suspected gunman checked his weapon in his baggage. Carnage broke out today at the Florida airport when a gunman opened fire at a baggage claim area, killing five people, according to the Broward County Sheriff's Office. Senior officials confirm that the suspected shooter, identified by authorities as Esteban Santiago, flew into the airport today from Anchorage via Minneapolis. The gun was checked in Santiago's luggage, a source familiar with the investigation told ABC News. What many may not be aware of is that flying with a firearm is allowed -- as long as proper procedure is followed. The traveler must also make sure to comply with any local, state or international laws concerning possession, according to the Transportation Security Administration. There are steps one must take to properly store his or her firearm in his or her checked luggage. First, the firearm must be unloaded and stored in a locked, hard-sided container that cannot be easily accessed. Only the passenger should retain the key or combination to the lock. The traveler then needs to declare the firearm or ammunition to the airline at the ticket counter. Firearm parts, ammunition and replica firearms may only be transported in checked luggage. Flying with firearms is not new and people do it legally and safely every day. However, many travelers appear to misunderstand the rules when it comes to stowing firearms in carry-ons. Attempting to go through security and board an aircraft with a firearm, loaded or unloaded, is illegal and you will be arrested. And yet, it happens every day. During the first eight months of 2016, the TSA has discovered more than 2,150 firearms in passengers’ carry-ons nationwide during routine screening of personal property at security checkpoints. “Every day at airports across the country, TSA officers detect firearms -- many of them loaded -- during the security checkpoint screening process,” said Cliff Van Leuven, TSA federal security director for Minnesota. “Passengers are allowed to travel with firearms, but it is important that certain procedures are followed to ensure it is done legally.” You can learn about how to safely and legally stow your firearm when you fly at this link.",news
1000,That's a lot of candles! Indonesian man claiming to be the oldest human in history has a birthday party to celebrate turning 146 ,"A man who claims to be the oldest human ever has just had a party to celebrate turning 146. Saparman Sodimejo, also known as Mbah Gotho, has an Indonesian ID card that purports his date of birth is December 31, 1870. He celebrated his birthday with his living relatives in the Seragaen district of Central Java. Attending his party were his grandson Suryanto and wife Suwarni, with their children Erika Kurniawati and Anisa Kurniawati, among other younger surviving relatives. He has, unsurprisingly, outlived all 10 of his siblings as well as his four wives, the last of whom died in 1988. All of his children have also died, and now he is survived by his grandchildren, great grandchildren, and great-great grandchildren. Despite his alleged advanced age the man is still able to walk and move independently. If correct, that makes him significantly older than the verified oldest person in the world ever, a title that belongs to French woman Jeanne Calment, who lived to be 122.  'He eats everything and has never even been ill,' a family member said.  Suryanto, Mbah Gotho's grandson, said his grandfather has been preparing for his death ever since he was 122, but it never seemed to come. He said: 'The gravestone there was made in 1992. That was 24 years ago.' In addition, Suryanto said Mbah Gotho's family has already prepared a gravesite for him - near his children's graves. Staff at the Indonesian records office have confirmed Mbah Gotho's birthdate, which is specified on his Indonesian ID card as 31st December 1870.  Whether or not he will ever be listed as the world's oldest man however is open to question, as the paperwork has so far not been independently verified.  If so he will join to others without verifiable records who are purportedly older than Mbah Gotho - 171-year-old James Olofintuyi from Nigeria and 163-year-old Dhaqabo Ebba from Ethiopia. These days, his grandchildren say Mbah Gotho mostly sits listening to the radio because his eyesight is too poor to watch television. In the last six months, he has had to be spoon-fed and bathed as he has become increasingly frail.",news
